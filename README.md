# Sales_Prediction_Regression and Gem_Price_Prediction

In this project,using a simple dataset which consisted of total sellings of a clothing product with its date, a model was created which could predict the sellings in future.One interesting thing to note in the prediction is that the model actually catches the trend of sellings going high around November-December as they are holiday seasons.


The other project in this repository,given two featuers of a Gem Stone(dimensions),the model predicts the price of the gem stone.As it is a regression model there there is no Accuracy metric but we can observe that the predicted values are almost same as the true prices of the gem stones.
